# Online-Payments-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Online Payments Fraud Detection using Machine Learning is a project that builds a predictive system to flag suspicious transactions before they go through. By analyzing a large set of historical payment records—each labeled as “fraud” or “legit”—we:

Explore & clean the data, handling skewed transaction amounts and engineering new features (e.g. balance changes, transaction‐type encodings).
Train and compare several classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to identify patterns that distinguish fraud from normal behavior.
Evaluate performance using metrics like ROC AUC, precision, and recall, ensuring the model reliably catches as many true fraud cases as possible with minimal false alarms.
In short, it’s a complete end‑to‑end pipeline—from raw CSV logs to a tuned machine‑learning model—that helps financial institutions detect and prevent payment fraud in real time.
